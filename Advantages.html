There are a number of advantages to the database approach. <br>
 These are discussed in more detail in the topic Database Systems. <br>
 Some of the advantages of a database system are summarised below.

<table>
 <tr>
    <th> Data management  </th>
    <td> 	A DBMS provides a mechanism for easier <br> 
	management of the data held by an organisation.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Data independence </th>
    <td> In a database system the data is held independently <br>
	of the application programs that use it. <br>
	Changes to the data or the way it is stored will <br>
	not necessarily affect the programs that use the data.</td> 
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Data consistency </th>
    <td>A database system is designed to reduce redundancy.<br>
	Items of data are ideally only stored in one location. <br>
	When updates are made to data, changes should only need to<br>
	be made to this one location.  This greatly improves the consistency <br>
	of the results of queries made on the database.</td> 
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <th> Data sharing </th>
    <td> The collection of data in a central data repository<br>
	and managed by a DBMS allows the data to be shared <br>
	by several users and applications.</td> 
    
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <th>Increased productivity </th>
    <td> File structures are already determined in the database structure.<br>
	New application programs can then be developed that use these structures.<br>
	This results in shorter development times.</td> 
    
  </tr>
    </tr>
     <tr>
    <th>Reduced maintenance </th>
    <td> A number of tools for maintaining the data are already	<br>
	built in to most DBMS.  Tools may include report generators,<br>
	query languages, form generators, code checkers,<br>
	data dictionaries and maintenance logs..</td>
